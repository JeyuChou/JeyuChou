- 👋 Hi, I’m Je-Yu Chou, but I go with the name Leo
- 👀 I’m a college student studying CS and a bit obsessed with exploring new things like machine learning and quantum computation.
- 🌱 I’m currently exploring quantum computation through qiskit, with projects such as QAOA, VQE, Shor's Algorithm, and others.
- 💞️ I’m looking forward to be able to work with professionals and push the boundaries of my knowledge just a tiny bit further. 
- 📫 Please reach me via email through leochou94@gmail.com! I want to learn more about everything :)
